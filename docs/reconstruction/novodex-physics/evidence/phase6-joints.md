# Phase 6 joints and effectors — reconstruction evidence

This file records Phase 6 evidence. It begins with the harness and an audit of
the export contract, because the second turned out to bound the first.

## 6a. State on entry

`program.json` records phases 4 through 8 as `pending`. The oracle census is
complete: 6,338 function rows and 5,138 data objects, 0 unexplained bytes. Of the
6,338 function rows, 663 are `reconstructed`, 115 `dynamically_gated`, 6
`statically_reviewed` and 5,554 `discovered`; no row is `closed`, and `closed` is
the Phase 8 audit's to grant.

`gate_targets.ps1` maps phases 6, 7 and 8 to empty differential target arrays, so
`run_phase_gate.ps1 -Phase 6` reports `status=skipped
reason=no_registered_test_targets`. Phase 6 has no harness and no closure ledger.

Phase 6's own plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-09-novodex-physics-phase6-joints-effectors.md`)
calls for `tests/PhysicsJointTests.cpp` and `joint_model.json`. Neither existed.

## 6b. The harness exists, and it is a new translation unit

Created `tests/PhysicsJointTests.cpp` and wired it as the `NxPhysicsJointTests`
target in `CMakeLists.txt`.

**Why a new file rather than more cases in `PhysicsObjectLayoutTests.cpp`.** That
harness's `wmain` carries a ~250 KB frame against the CRT's 1 MB stack, and any
change to it arms a jump through a 0xA5 fixture fill. Five rounds of conversion
work did not remove it, and it is recorded across
`evidence/phase5-object-model.md` 3z262-3z289. A new translation unit has no such
history; this is the unblocked path Phase 6's plan already specified.

**What it does.** It loads the pair through `PhysicsPairLoader.h` -- the same
isolated-directory, module-audit, SHA-256-identity machinery every other
differential uses -- creates the SDK through the exported `NxCreatePhysicsSDK`,
builds a two-actor dynamic fixture, drives the revolute family over four
anchor/axis cases, and prints every input and output word as raw hexadecimal. It
decides nothing; `run_differential.ps1` compares its transcript between the two
pairs.

**Two implementation notes that cost a build each**, recorded so they are not
rediscovered:

- `NxJointDesc::setGlobalAnchor` and `setGlobalAxis` are inline and call two
  exported rows, so using the inline methods adds imports for
  `__imp__NxJointDesc_SetGlobalAnchor` and `__imp__NxJointDesc_SetGlobalAxis`.
  This harness loads the pair by `LoadLibraryEx` and links against neither side's
  import library, so both rows are resolved with `GetProcAddress` and called
  through function pointers.
- `NxActorDesc::isValid()` accepts either a body with a mass *and* a mass-space
  inertia, or a non-zero density with at least one shape. A default `NxBodyDesc`
  carries mass 0 and zero inertia, so a fixture that sets neither makes
  `createActor` return null. The fixture takes the density route: `density = 1.0`
  with one box shape.

**Measured against the oracle.** Exit 0, and the transcript is byte-identical
across three runs (SHA-256 `9804d0d6ae18ce3b…`), so it is a usable differential
transcript rather than a noisy one. It reports all four revolute cases created,
anchor and axis reading back as passed, actors matching, and release clean. One
case is informative: index 3 passes axis `3f000000.3f000000.3f000000`
(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and reads back `3f13cd3a.3f13cd3a.3f13cd3a` -- the oracle
normalises the axis, and the transcript pins that.

## 6c. The export contract is missing three rows, and two are Phase 6's

Audited with `dumpbin /exports`:

    oracle Binaries/NxPhysics.dll          41 named exports
    candidate build/Release/NxPhysics.dll  38 named exports

    missing from the candidate:
      NxJointDesc_SetGlobalAnchor
      NxJointDesc_SetGlobalAxis
      NxCreatePMap

`program.json` pins `oracle.named_exports: 41`, and Phase 8's gate requires the
candidate's export table to equal the oracle's with ordinals. A three-row gap
therefore fails that gate on its own, independently of any behavioural evidence.

**Two of the three are genuinely unimplemented.** Searching the whole of
`Physics/src` for `NxJointDesc_SetGlobalAnchor` and `NxJointDesc_SetGlobalAxis`
returns nothing, so the source does not define them at all. They are the two
Phase 6 rows the plan names explicitly ("include the exported
`NxJointDesc_SetGlobalAnchor` and `NxJointDesc_SetGlobalAxis` rows and record
exact transform/evaluation order"), and the joint harness cannot run against the
candidate until they exist: it reports
`export=NxJointDesc_SetGlobalAnchor present=no` and stops.

**The third is an export-list gap, not a missing body.** `NxReleasePMap` is both
defined and exported (`Physics/src/PMap.cpp`), while `NxCreatePMap` appears in
that file only inside comments. Whether it is unexported, misnamed, or a body
that was never written is not established here and is not claimed.

**The `pairs/candidate` staging is also stale.** Its `NxPhysics.dll` is 37,376
bytes and contains neither `NxCreatePMap` nor `NxReleasePMap`, while the current
`build/Release/NxPhysics.dll` contains `NxReleasePMap`. Any differential run
against that staged pair measures an older candidate than the tree, so the
staging has to be refreshed before its transcripts mean anything. This is the
same class of hazard as 3z266 and 3z276: an instrument returning a reading that
belongs to an earlier state.

## 6d. What is not done

- The nine other joint families are **not driven**: spherical, prismatic,
  cylindrical, point-on-line, point-in-plane, D6, distance, fixed and pulley.
  `PhysicsJointTests.cpp` says so in its own header rather than reporting a
  coverage figure that overstates.
- The two exported rows are **not implemented**.
- `joint_model.json` does **not** exist.
- `NxPhysicsJointTests` is **not registered** as a differential target, because
  it cannot pass against the candidate until the two rows exist and the staging
  is refreshed. Registering it now would turn phase 6 from `skipped` into a
  failure without adding evidence.

No rows move. No gate, coverage-floor, or policy change.
