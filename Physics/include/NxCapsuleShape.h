/**
A capsule shaped collision detection primitive, also known as a line swept sphere.

'radius' is the radius of the capsule's hemispherical ends and its trunk.
'height' is the distance between the two hemispherical ends of the capsule.  
The height is along the capsule's Y axis.

Each shape is owned by an actor that it is attached to.

An instance can be created by calling the createShape() method of the NxActor object
that should own it, with a NxCapsuleShapeDesc object as the parameter, or by adding the 
shape descriptor into the NxActorDesc class before creating the actor.

The shape is deleted by calling NxActor::releaseShape() on the owning actor.
