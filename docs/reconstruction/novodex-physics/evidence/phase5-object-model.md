# Phase 5 Task 1: the object model, locked from constructors and vtable stores

Every claim below carries the address that establishes it. Where Phase 3
borrowed a Shape offset under its relay rule, this task re-derives it from a
constructor rather than inheriting it — and the re-derivation changed the
picture in one important way (three poses, not two).

Inputs: `evidence/phase5-vtable-census.json` (slot maps rebuilt from
`oracle/pe.json`'s decoded pointer records and validated against every
recorded preview), the Capstone listing, and constructor listings read
instruction by instruction.

---

## 1. The actor family

**NxActor declares exactly 88 virtuals** (`NxActor.h`). The census found two
large tables:

| table | rva | slots | distinct targets | reading |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `phys_data_000678` | `.rdata 0x101043d0` | 87 | **4** | abstract base's vtable: slot 0 dtor + slots 63/64 real; the other 84 are one pure-call filler, `phys_fn_005667` |
| `phys_data_000679` | `.rdata 0x10104530` | 88 | **88**, all phase 5 | the concrete dynamic-actor implementation |

The two share exactly slots 63/64 (`phys_fn_000038`/`phys_fn_000040`) — the
only behaviour the base implements beyond destruction.

The concrete pair, from their listings:

- **ctor `phys_fn_000044` (0x2480, 53 bytes)** — stores the base vptr at +0
  (`0x101043d0`, 0x2489), zeroes +4, constructs an embedded polymorphic
  subobject at **+8** (member ctor `phys_fn_002404` at call `0x1005ba70`,
  which installs vptr `0x101088b8` and zeroes two dwords), then overwrites
  that subobject's vptr with `0x1010468c` (0x249f) — a one-slot table sitting
  at TBL_88's tail, which is why the census merged it into the 88-slot run —
  stores its argument at **+0x14** (0x24a5), and finishes with the derived
  vptr `0x10104530` (0x24a9).
- **dtor `phys_fn_000118` (0x3650, 55 bytes)** — mirrors it: derived vptr,
  member vptr, member dtor `phys_fn_002406`, base vptr, then conditional
  delete through the SDK allocator global `0x101041bc` slot +0x14.
- **base deleting dtor `phys_fn_000042` (0x2460, 31 bytes)**.

Open: what the +8 subobject interfaces with (one virtual), and what the +0x14
argument means.

## 2. The shape family

Base-shape vtable `0x10107494`, installed by the shared ctor. Per-type finals,
with both dispatch slots Phase 3 could not close:

| type | final vtable | ctor rows | slot 5 (raycast) | slot 7 (sweep dispatch) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BOX | `0x10106ab8` | `000977`, `000979` | `000949` p3 | `000951` p5 |
| CAPSULE | `0x10106b20` | `000987` | `001010` p3 | `001012` p3 |
| PLANE | `0x10107430` | `001247` | `001261` p3 | `001035` p3 (= base's target; plane does not override) |
| SPHERE | `0x10107528` | `001349` | `001377` p3 | `001373` p3 |
| MESH | `0x10107630` | `001379` | `001405` p3 | `001407` p3 |

**Slot 7 resolves at byte level for every type.** Phase 3's "unresolved" was
behavioural (what the sweep does), not byte absence — the continuous-collision
stop is narrower than it looked.

## 3. The Shape layout, from the shared constructor

`phys_fn_001273` (0x25530, 424 bytes) writes:

- `+0x00` vptr `0x10107494` (0x2553d); `+0x04` = **owner** = ctor arg 1
  (0x25543) — the borrowed claim confirmed from the constructor side;
- `+0x08` zeroed; then **THREE identity-initialised poses**: m33 diagonals at
  `+0x0c/+0x1c/+0x2c` with t at `+0x30..+0x38`; `+0x3c/+0x4c/+0x5c` with t at
  `+0x60..+0x68`; `+0x6c/+0x7c/+0x8c` with t at `+0x90..+0x98`
  (ebx=`0x3f800000` throughout);
- tail: `lea ecx,[esi+0xa4]` — another subobject constructed at +0xa4.

Consequences:

1. **Phase 3's "+0x3c..+0x68 second pose, unestablished" is established**: it
   is a real pose, identity-initialised by the constructor.
2. **There is a third pose at +0x6c..+0x98** that no earlier evidence named.
   Its role (saved previous? sweep source?) is open.
3. The sphere ctor confirms `+0x9c` end to end: allocates **exactly 0x1c
   bytes** through the SDK allocator (`[0x101041bc]` slot +8 with (size,0)),
   constructs them with `phys_fn_001193` (0x247c0), stores at **+0x9c**
   (0x27805); also initialises `+0xd0 = 1`.
4. `+0xe0` is a secondary-base vptr where a desc mix-in exists (box: base
   table `A @0x106a58` replaced by `B @0x106a88`, both 12 slots; sphere:
   NULLed). With geometry floats following at `+0xe4..+0xec`, this is
   consistent with Phase 3's box-half-extents/capsule-radius reads and
   refines rather than contradicts them.

## 3a. phys_fn_001273 transcribed: the +0xa4 subobject is a Prunable, and the shape owns it

Task 3 opened with the full transcription of `phys_fn_001273` into
`Physics/src/ObjectModel.cpp` (`ShapeBase`, 0xe0 bytes, static asserts on
every offset). What the complete listing adds to section 3:

1. **+0xa4 is `Prunable`** (phys_fn_004874, 0xb54a0 — the Phase 4 Ice
   reconstruction, 0x2c bytes ending exactly at +0xd0). And at 0x25649, after
   the prunable is built, the constructor stores **itself** into it:
   `mov [esi+0xa8],esi` writes the shape's address into `Prunable::mOwner`
   (+0xa4+0x04). The shape is its prunable's owner; what looked like an
   anonymous "another subobject" in section 3 is the scene-query prunable
   with its owner link set.
2. **The ctor installs the three Prunable owner adapters** that Phase 4 had
   to leave null because their only writer sat outside its population:
   `.data 0x10128470/74/78` receive `phys_fn_000965` (the folded
   `xor eax,eax; ret` stub), `phys_fn_001271` and `phys_fn_001269`
   (0x0002562b..3f). The two latter are 15-byte cdecl frames that push the
   box and call owner-vtable slot 10 (+0x28) and slot 9 (+0x24)
   respectively, with no null test. All three are now reconstructed rows;
   `IcePrunable.h`'s "written exactly once" note is discharged.
3. **The argument count is two, and the checkpoint's "+0xd4 = arg3" was a
   misread**: `ret 8` fixes two stack arguments, and `[esp+0x14]` at
   0x255e9 stands after three pushes (ebx/esi/edi), so it is entry
   `[esp+8]` — arg **2**. It is stored raw at +0xd4.
4. Tail fields: sentinel `+0xd0 = 0x7fffffff` (0x255ed); halfwords
   `+0xd8/+0xda` zeroed, `+0xdc = 6`, `+0xde = 8` (0x255fd..0x25614).
   A helper at 0x25760 reads +0xa0 as a null-tested pointer — unestablished.
5. The identity-pose stores run TWICE (0x25555..cd and again 0x2564f..cd,
   after the hook stores). Both passes write identical bytes, so the
   transcription stores once; recorded here so nobody re-derives a mystery.

Driven: the layout gate grew a `shapebase` family — the oracle constructor
runs on a poisoned 0xe0 buffer (owner NULL; the registration arm through
`[owner+4]+0x48` → phys_fn_002423 waits for Task 4 actors) with a marked
second argument, five module-specific pointer words masked out of both
sides (`+0x00/+0xa4/+0xa8/+0xb0/+0xb4`: both vtables, the owner store, the
prunable's back-pointer, the inner member's vptr). Oracle digest
`de5f5000`; candidate identical bitwise; `owner_self` asserted. Registrations
17 lines, oracle digest `1c848a60`, coverage floor 17.

## 3b. The BOX final: constructor transcribed, primary slot map resolved, and a probe lesson

Task 3 continued with `phys_fn_000977` (0x21870, 207 bytes), the BOX
constructor, into `Physics/src/ObjectModel.cpp` (`BoxShape`,
`sizeof == 0xe0 + 0x148`, facade embedded at +0xe0):

1. **The primary BOX slot map is resolved** through the merged run at
   0x106a58 (indices 24..40 = BOX slots 0..16): `000979, 001347(p3),
   001277(p3), 000945, 000947, 000949, 001315(p3), 000951, 000941, 000935,
   000937, 000939, 000981, 000927, 001391(p3)×3`. Slot 5 is the Phase 3
   raycast partner; slot 7 is the sweep entry — both byte-level targets were
   already in the census, now they sit in an ordered map.
2. **The ctor forwards BOTH arguments unchanged** to phys_fn_001273
   (0x2187c..80) and then: installs the final BOX vptr (0x2188f; the wall-A
   store at 0x21885 is a chained-construction intermediate, never
   observable); zeroes the first THREE words of each of the six face records
   at +0x150 (corners + both index lists — float data stays POISONED until
   the face builder runs, and so do the vertices at +0xf0..+0x14f);
   allocates a 0x1c-byte collision object through the SDK allocator
   (`malloc(0x1c, 0)`), constructs it with **phys_fn_001075** (the same
   57-byte body as phys_fn_001193 but box-family tables 0x106d08/6e54/6dc8),
   stores it at +0x9c; **overwrites the base ctor's +0xd0 sentinel with 2**;
   seeds dims 1.0f×3 into the facade gap (+0xe4..ec).
3. **Probe lesson, recorded because it cost a crash to find**: driving the
   ctor on a bare LoadLibrary process faults at 0x218fe — the SDK allocator
   holder word is NULL until an NxPhysicsSDK exists (as phase4-formats.md
   already said). The gate now installs a minimal shim interface at the
   holder so every instruction of phys_fn_000977/phys_fn_001075 still runs
   natively; only the 28 bytes come from the shim. A first shim draft also
   wrote the wrong word (`memcpy(dst,&array,4)` copies element [0], not the
   array's address) — caught by chain readback before it could mislead.

Driven: new `boxshape` family — poisoned 0x228 twin buffers, seven pointer
words masked (both final vtables, colobj pointer, four base-ctor pointers).
Oracle digest `ac5ed12f`; candidate identical bitwise; poison preservation,
face zeroing, sentinel=2, dims and the back-pointing colobj all asserted.
Registrations 18 lines, oracle digest `dc5e5ec6`, coverage floor 18.

## 3c. The SPHERE final transcribed — and a census mislabel corrected

Task 3 continued with `phys_fn_001349` (0x277c0, 91 bytes), the SPHERE
constructor, into `Physics/src/ObjectModel.cpp` (`SphereShape`,
`sizeof == 0xe4`, radius at +0xe0):

1. **The sphere has NO secondary base.** The ctor forwards both arguments to
   phys_fn_001273 (0x277bb..cf), stores the SPHERE vptr 0x10107528
   (0x277d4), and ZEROES the dword at +0xe0 (0x277da) — where the box embeds
   its facade, the sphere keeps plain data, and its first datum is the
   radius. The descriptor path later writes it directly (0x27850 reads the
   descriptor's word +0x4c straight into +0xe0).
2. The collision object is built by **phys_fn_001193 ITSELF** (call
   0x277fc) — the generic row, unlike the box's per-type variant — from an
   SDK-allocator block (`malloc(0x1c,0)`), stored at +0x9c (0x27805). The
   sentinel is overwritten with **1** (0x2780b): box 2, sphere 1 so far.
3. **Correction to this file's own §4 note**: the function I had tentatively
   read as the sphere ctor is the **MESH ctor** — `phys_fn_001379`
   (0x27db0, 101 bytes) stores vptr 0x10107630, nulls BOTH +0xe0 and +0xe4,
   builds its collision object through **phys_fn_001241** (0x24e40, another
   57-byte variant row) and overwrites the sentinel with **4**. What §4
   called "sphere: NULLed" is really the mesh nulling two words; the sphere
   ctor nulls exactly one because that word IS its radius.

Driven: new `sphere` family — poisoned 0xe4 twin buffers, six pointer words
masked. Oracle digest `37ea7205`; candidate identical bitwise; radius zero,
sentinel 1 and the back-pointing colobj asserted. Registrations 19 lines,
oracle digest `bd8572e2`, coverage floor 19. The allocator shim moved into a
shared helper both shape probes install.

## 3d. CAPSULE and PLANE transcribed; the +0xd0 sentinel PROVEN to be NxShapeType

Task 3 continued with two more constructors into `Physics/src/ObjectModel.cpp`
(`CapsuleShape`, `sizeof == 0xe8`; `PlaneShape`, `sizeof == 0x10c`):

1. **The +0xd0 sentinel is the NxShapeType tag — proven, not guessed.** The
   pinned `Physics/include/NxShape.h` enumerates
   PLANE=0, SPHERE=1, BOX=2, CAPSULE=3, MESH=4, COMPOUND=5. The ctors write
   exactly those constants after zeroing/overwriting the base's 0x7fffffff:
   sphere 1 (§3c), box 2, capsule **3** (`phys_fn_000987`, store 0x21ab5),
   mesh 4 (§3c), plane **0** (`phys_fn_001247`, store 0x24f24).
2. **CAPSULE** (phys_fn_000987, 0x21a60): forwards both args to the base
   ctor, zeroes TWO data words at +0xe0/+0xe4 (radius/half-height
   candidates — named by nothing yet), builds its collision object through
   the capsule-family variant **phys_fn_001123** (0x23cb0) and stores it at
   +0x9c.
3. **PLANE** (phys_fn_001247, 0x24ed0): plants the default plane equation —
   normal `(0,1,0)`, `D=0` at +0xe0..+0xec — then fills a tangent frame at
   +0xf0/+0xfc through **NxFoundation!NxNormalToTangents**, called via the
   import at `.rdata 0x1010418c` (14 call sites, no in-image writer). The
   transcription calls the reconstruction's own export of the same NovodeX
   algorithm; for the default normal the arithmetic is exact, so both sides
   fold identical bits. Sets +0x108 = 1. Its collision object comes from the
   plane-family variant **phys_fn_001159** (0x24250). This vindicates the
   census's PLANE table 0x107430.
4. **COMPOUND identified by elimination**: phys_fn_001033 (0x22d60) writes
   sentinel **5** and stores table .rdata 0x106c2c — so the earlier guess
   that 0x106c2c was "plane" is dead; the compound ctor also nulls two
   vec3-sized triplets (+0xe0/+0xf0), writes halfword +0xd8 = 0xffff and
   float -1.0f at +0x10c, and builds NO collision object. It stays
   untranscribed.

Driven: new `capsule` and `plane` families on poisoned twins (six pointer
words masked each; the plane folds its tangents IN). Oracle digests
`9b0768d7` / `abed37e0`; candidates identical bitwise. Registrations 21
lines, oracle digest `a6f9c9fe`, coverage floor 21.

## 3e. MESH transcribed — the six shape-family constructors are now decoded

Task 3 continued with `phys_fn_001379` (0x27db0, 101 bytes), the MESH
constructor, into `Physics/src/ObjectModel.cpp` (`MeshShape`,
`sizeof == 0xe8`): forwards both arguments to phys_fn_001273
(0x27dbb..bf), stores the MESH vptr 0x10107630 (0x27dc4), zeroes TWO data
words at +0xe0/+0xe4 (a triangle-mesh pointer and a flag word are the
natural candidates; nothing in this ctor names them — the descriptor path
will), builds its collision object through the mesh-family variant
**phys_fn_001241** (0x24e40) into +0x9c, and overwrites the sentinel with
**4** = NX_SHAPE_MESH.

With this, every shape-family constructor is accounted for from listings:

| type | ctor | sentinel | colobj variant | tail data |
|------|------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| plane | phys_fn_001247 | 0 | phys_fn_001159 | equation + tangent frame (+0x108=1) |
| sphere | phys_fn_001349 | 1 | phys_fn_001193 (generic) | radius @+0xe0 |
| box | phys_fn_000977 | 2 | phys_fn_001075 | hull facade + dims, faces ptr-zeroed |
| capsule | phys_fn_000987 | 3 | phys_fn_001123 | two zeroed floats |
| mesh | phys_fn_001379 | 4 | phys_fn_001241 | two zeroed words |
| compound | phys_fn_001033 | 5 | NONE | triplets +0xe0/+0xf0, +0xd8=ffff, -1.0f@+0x10c |

The compound stays untranscribed; its ctor is decoded in §3d.

Driven: new `mesh` family on a poisoned 0xe8 twin (six pointer words
masked). Oracle digest `422a1f78`; candidate identical bitwise.
Registrations 22 lines, oracle digest `ba13689f`, coverage floor 22.

## 3f. The BASE vtable's slot map, and its first three behavior rows

The BASE shape table `.rdata 0x107494` (12 slots, from the pe.json pointer
records — slot → target):

| slot | target | row | state |
|------|--------|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0x00027710 | phys_fn_001345 (34 B): scalar deleting dtor — calls 0x26bd0 then frees through SDK-allocator slot +0x14 when flag&1 | discovered |
| 1 | 0x00027740 | descriptor-driven update: copies a pose into +0x6c, halfwords from the desc, colobj+4; calls 0xedc0/0x26d90 | discovered |
| 2 | 0x000256f0 | **phys_fn_001277** (98 B): save-to-descriptor — pose3 + halfword trio + [colobj+4] into a record, returns true | **reconstructed** |
| 3 | 0x00025960 | phys_fn_001305 (685 B): x87 world-bounds-class computation against globals 0x10123bc8/0x10123b4c | discovered |
| 4 | 0x00024f70 | **phys_fn_001249**: `xor al,al; ret 0xc` — two args, false | **reconstructed** |
| 5 | 0x000b4070 | **phys_fn_004812**: `xor eax,eax; ret 0x14` — four args, null | **reconstructed** |
| 6 | 0x000266a0 | phys_fn_001315 (1061 B): owner/scene-touching update (reads [owner+4]+0x540) | discovered |
| 7 | 0x00022dd0 | **phys_fn_001035**: `xor al,al; ret 8` — the sweep stub Phase 3 left unresolved | **reconstructed** |
| 8–11 | 0x000f41dc ×4 | purecall filler | filler |

The three stub rows are transcribed as `ShapeBase` members
(`nxBaseSlot4/nxBaseSlot5/nxBaseSlot7`) and driven by a new `basevt`
family: the oracle rows run on a dummy this with marked arguments, the
candidate members answer through the reconstruction, both fold to the same
transcript (`ret4=0 ret5=00000000 ret7=0`). Slot 7's closure is exact: it is
Phase 3's continuous-collision sweep entry, and what the base shape does
with it is answer "no sweep" — the finals' overrides (box phys_fn_000951
etc.) remain the sweep's owning rows. Slots 0–1 and 3/6 stay open until
their drives exist; making `ShapeBase` polymorphic waits for them.

**Slot 2 corrected and closed.** The first draft of this section called slot
2 a "deleting-dtor thunk" — wrong; that snippet lives at 0x256e0 in a
different function. The listing shows phys_fn_001277 is the WRITE-side
partner of slot 1: a save-to-descriptor row copying pose three (12 words)
to record+8, zero-extending halfword +0xde to record+0x38, moving halfwords
+0xd8/+0xda to record+0x3c/0x3e, and reading **[colobj+4] unconditionally**
into record+0x40 before returning true. Transcribed as
`ShapeBase::nxBaseSaveState` and driven by the new `basesave` family on a
real constructed sphere: oracle digest `bc9dc964`, candidate bitwise equal
over the whole poisoned 0x48-byte record. The differential caught a
first-draft transcription bug — I had read `[colobj]` (the vptr word,
0x6b...) instead of `[colobj+4]` — before it could ship, which is exactly
the failure mode this gate exists for. Driven: registrations now 24 lines, oracle
digest `4aa4d389`, coverage floor 24.

## 3g. The first BOX-final behavior row

`phys_fn_000937` (0x20670, 69 bytes), BOX-table slot 10, transcribed as
`BoxShape::nxBoxCenterAndDiagonal`: writes the pose-one translation to
out[0..2] and `sqrt(dx²+dy²+dz²)` over the facade dims to out[3]. Driven by
a new `boxrow` family on a real constructed box: oracle words
`00000000.00000000.00000000.3fddb3d7` (center = origin, diagonal = √3),
candidate bitwise identical — at the constructor-default dims every x87
association of the sum is exact, so the drive is valid while the
general-dims association stays an explicitly open question in the header.
Registrations 25 lines, oracle digest `629e8ada`, coverage floor 25.

Extended: slots 11 and 13 closed the same way. Slot 11 (`phys_fn_000939`)
zeroes a caller vec3 and writes the identical diagonal; slot 13
(`phys_fn_000927`) writes dims to record+0x4c — exactly where the box
constructor read `desc+0x4c` — then **tail-jumps to the BASE save-state row**,
so the transcription composes `nxBaseSaveState` rather than duplicating it.
Oracle digests `2f2dc4eb` / `853c971d`, both bitwise equal on poisoned twins.
A census bookkeeping slip (a duplicated inventory row for 927/939) was caught
and fixed before commit; registrations 26 lines, oracle digest `053011c2`,
coverage floor 26.

Extended again: slots 8 and 9 closed. Slot 8 (`phys_fn_000941`) is the box's
local AABB — negated dims then raw dims, six words. Slot 9
(`phys_fn_000935`, 198 bytes) is the OBB world-AABB: per-axis extents
`|rot-row . dims|` over pose one (axis0 r0/r2/r1, axis1 r3/r5/r4, axis2
r6/r8/r7) with `min = t − ext`, `max = t + ext`. On the identity pose the
arithmetic is exact, so both drives fold bitwise (`d8 == d9 == 8428d8b5`,
minmax `bf800000×3 / 3f800000×3`); the image's mixed single/extended
rounding of partial sums stays open for general poses. Registrations 27
lines, oracle digest `f1d18d6a`, coverage floor 27. BOX slots now closed:
2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13. Open: 0/1 (dtor + apply-desc chain), 3 (debug draw),
4 (cached-bounds update via 0x1c8c0), 5 (raycast), 7 (sweep), 12
(loadFromDesc), 14–16.

Extended: **slots 14–16 closed** — they are the SAME three-byte row,
`phys_fn_001391` (`mov eax,ecx; ret`), an identity/self-return that ignores
its arguments; transcribed as `BoxShape::nxBoxSelf()` and driven by pointer
equality on a real constructed box (stable on both sides; never folded).
Slot 0 (`phys_fn_000979`) is now fully DECODED but deliberately unclaimed:
it destroys the embedded collision object through `[colobj-vtbl+0]` with
flag 1 UNCONDITIONALLY, runs the base-dtor chain (owner arms, +0xa0 arms,
Prunable tail), then frees `this` through SDK-allocator slot +0x14 when
flag&1 — a safe drive needs the allocator shim extended with free slots and
a careful post-mortem observation design, so it stays discovered until that
lands. Registrations 28 lines, oracle digest `5f1bb91b`, coverage floor 28.

**Slot 0 then closed.** Extending the shim exposed a REAL ABI fact worth
recording: the shipped allocator's free slots take ONE pushed argument and
the callee pops it (callers do `push x; call [slot]` with no esp fixup),
while malloc takes two — a shim whose free popped the wrong count drifted
the stack four bytes per call and corrupted the caller's return address
(fault to `0x1`). With the corrected free stubs plus the destruction-time
vptr words added to the mask (+0x00/+0xe0 restored by the dtor dance), the
flag=0 path folds bitwise: `boxdtor` digest `a29800b7`, candidate equal.
The colobj's own deleting-dtor row (`0x235d0`) stays its own census row.
Registrations 29 lines, oracle digest `5defe17a`, coverage floor 29.

## 4. The census merge resolved

The census flagged its 41-slot row at `0x106a58` as overrunning BOX. It is
three real tables ending together at `0x106afc`: A(12) + B(12) + BOX(17).
Separately, `phys_fn_000973` (p2, 913 bytes) installs **twelve** small
vtables (`0x10106998`–`0x10106a48`) — almost certainly the descriptor
`setToDefault` family, which Task 2 owns confirming.

## 5. The RED layout gate

`NxPhysicsObjectLayoutTests` pins this task's structural claims against the
shipped DLL and is registered for Phase 5 RED on purpose -- three
`CANDIDATE-MISSING` families (vtables, collision object, owner accessor)
until Tasks 2 and 3 transcribe the classes:

- eight `vt` digests over the loaded oracle's slot words: both actor tables
  in full, and twelve-slot windows of every shape final plus the base table;
- `colobj`: phys_fn_001193 run on a poisoned 0x1c buffer -- the oracle's own
  constructor writes vptr `0x10107218`, zeroes +4, stores the argument at
  BOTH +8 and +0x18, and installs member vptr `0x101072a0`, exactly as the
  listing predicts (`digest=e1df25e5`);
- `owner`: phys_fn_001281 returns the mark planted at fake-shape +0x04,
  confirming the borrowed field through the accessor Phase 3 closed.

Oracle digest `99eee5c2`; twelve registrations; Phase 5 coverage floor 12.

**First transcriptions landed (Task 2 opened early).** `Physics/src/ObjectModel.cpp`
carries `CollisionObject` (phys_fn_001193) and `nxShapeOwner`
(phys_fn_001281), with layout static asserts; the harness now answers both
candidate families through the reconstruction -- `colobj ok=1` and
`owner ok=1` against the same poisoned-buffer/mark probes the oracle side
runs -- and the gate's red count is down from three to one. The remaining
missing family is `vtables`, which waits on the shape/actor classes.

A defect caught before it could mislead: the first candidate run failed
`colobj` with a stack address where the argument belonged -- the harness had
passed `&kArg` where the row takes the value. The oracle side was never
wrong; only the probe was.

## 5a. The six records at Shape+0x150 — corrected twice

`phys_fn_000973` (0x21420, 913 bytes, phase 2) constructs **six 36-byte
records at Shape+0x150, stride 0x24**: `{ dword 4; const dword* listA;
const dword* listB; six dwords of float data }`, called from two small
mutators (`phys_fn_000981` p5, `phys_fn_000983` p3) that first copy the box
dims into `+0xe4..+0xec` — Phase 3's half-extent claim confirmed from the
write side.

Two readings of this row were published here and both were wrong:

1. *"a descriptor setToDefault family"* — withdrawn when the listing showed
   one function building six subobjects, not twelve functions.
2. *"twelve small vtables"* — withdrawn on the bytes: pe.json records **no
   relocations** at any of the twelve addresses, and the raw words are small
   integer runs (`0 1 2 3 | 1 5 6 2`, ...), not function entries. They are
   static index data:

- the **listA family** chains face quads over an 8-corner numbering:
  `[0,1,2,3 | 1,5,6,2]` → `[1,5,6,2 | 5,4,7,6]` → … cycling all six faces;
- the **listB family** reaches corner ids up to 11 (`[1,8,5,9]`,
  `[11,3,10,7]`) — a second topology this task has not named;
- the float areas carry face normals as constants (±X, ±Y, ±Z), which for a
  box are dim-independent.

So the six subobjects are per-face records of the box — spheres, capsules
and planes never call this row. What consumes them (sweep? hull queries?)
and what the two index families count are open. Separately, the `+0xe0`
subobject's abstract table at `0x106a58` is a pure-call wall, and its final
table at `0x106a88` is twelve slots whose targets are ALL phase-5 rows
(`phys_fn_000953`..`phys_fn_000985`) — Task 3's to reconstruct. The census's
merged 41-slot row spans exactly [purecall wall][12-slot concrete][BOX final],
and its distinct-target figure treated static data as slots.

A defect worth keeping on the record: the first build HUNG rather than ran.
The cause was an address-space mixup in the harness itself -- censused RVAs
pasted into a field named `va` and subtracted by the image base a second
time, sending every read ~4 GB past the module. A crash sitting in a Windows
Error Reporting dialog looks exactly like a hang from a redirected-process
watchdog, and nothing in stdout says so. The minimal read probe
(`build/probe_read.cpp`) is what separated "the module cannot be read" from
"my pointer is wrong"; one was environment, the other was the bug.

## 5b. The +0xe0 subobject named: the box's convex-hull descriptor

The twelve-slot final table at `0x106a88` decodes as a facade over the hull:

| slot | row | behaviour |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 0 | `phys_fn_000985` | lazy shared-hook accessor — **transcribed** |
| 1 | `phys_fn_000953` | `mov eax,8` — eight corners |
| 2 | `phys_fn_000955` | `lea eax,[ecx+0x10]` — the vertex array |
| 3 | `phys_fn_000961` | `mov eax,6` — six faces |
| 4 | `phys_fn_000963` | `index*36 + this+0x70` — face-record[k] |
| 5 | `phys_fn_000965` | returns 0 |
| 6-8 | `000967/969/971` | three static .rdata tables (`0x10122180/e0/240`) |
| 9-10 | `000957/000959` | algorithms (578/1062 bytes; the second copies a 3×3 matrix and projects) — untranscribed |
| 11 | `phys_fn_000975` | support mapping: ±FLT_MAX sentinels, then min/max over eight vertices at stride 0xc against a direction — **transcribed** |

Nine rows are transcribed in `BoxHullFacade` (`Physics/src/ObjectModel.cpp`)
— plus slot 0, which turned out to be a lazy shared-hook accessor rather
than a destructor: it once-guards a twelve-byte `.data` global at
`0x10123c64` whose initializer array (.rdata `0x10103010`) is twelve bare
`ret` stubs, so the global stays all-zero and the row returns its address.
Ten rows are driven both sides by the layout gate on twin buffers:
constants, `face(k)` pointer arithmetic (`0xb8` for k=2), static-table
content equality, the support bounds bitwise (`min=c19c0000 max=4eada5a5`
on the registered seed), and the shared hook (stable pointer, zero words).
The support frame decodes as (this, a1 unread, a2=&min, a3=&max, a4=dir,
a5=pose, a6 unread) — the sentinel stores name the outputs, which is how
the first wiring was corrected after it returned zeros. Three probe-side
defects were found and fixed on the way: `(unsigned const&)x` on a float
value-converts to unsigned (yielding 0 at these magnitudes) instead of
binding storage, so early "bits" prints lied; the shared-hook probe folded
its returned pointer into the digest although ASLR moves it between runs —
only stability and the pointed-to words are deterministic facts; and the
support sentinels were transcribed swapped before the frame decode named
them. Gate state: oracle digest `8d76f55d`, RED=1 (the vtables family —
shape/actor classes). Census: ten facade rows stand at `reconstructed`;
slots 9/10 (`phys_fn_000957/000959`) remain `discovered` until their
listings are transcribed and falsified.

## 6. What this task did not do

- No behavioural reconstruction: every row here stays `discovered` until a
  differential drives it.
- Actor +8 subobject semantics, TBL_87 slots 63/64 identity, third-pose role,
  and the twelve-descriptor mapping are recorded as open questions in
  `object_model.json`.
