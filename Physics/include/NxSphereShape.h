/**
A sphere shaped collision detection primitive.


Each shape is owned by an actor that it is attached to.

An instance can be created by calling the createShape() method of the NxActor object
that should own it, with a NxSphereShapeDesc object as the parameter, or by adding the 
shape descriptor into the NxActorDesc class before creating the actor.

The shape is deleted by calling NxActor::releaseShape() on the owning actor.
