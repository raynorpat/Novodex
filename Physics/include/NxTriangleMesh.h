/**

A triangle mesh, also called a 'polygon soup'. It is 
represented as an indexed triangle list. There are no restrictions on the
triangle data. 

However, you may use some settings to have the data be treated as a height field.
See NxTriangleMeshDesc for details.

To avoid duplicating data when you have several instances of a particular 
mesh positioned differently, you do not use this class to represent a 
mesh object directly. Instead, you create an instance of this mesh via
the NxTriangleMeshShape class.

To create an instance of this class call NxPhysicsSDK::createTriangleMesh(),
and NxPhysicsSDK::releaseTriangleMesh() to delete it. This is only possible
once you have released all of its NxTriangleMeshShape instances.
